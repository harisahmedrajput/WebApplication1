step #5
Users can quickly find specific information within a dataset by integrating search. Dynamic record filtering is made possible by the controller's index action in conjunction with a conditional query that is dependent on the search parameter. The corresponding view has an easy-to-use search form that makes it simple and intuitive for users to interact with and retrieve pertinent data.

step Six
The capabilities of the data model are extended by the addition of a new field through database migration and model validation.
In order to protect data consistency, the model-level validation makes sure the new field complies with predetermined standards, like presence and maximum length. Users can now input and manipulate the additional data with ease thanks to the update to the view, especially the form template, which accommodates the new field.



step - 7
Validation in the model and controller safeguards the integrity of the application's data.
By imposing rules on the allowed content and structure of data, validation prevents erroneous or incomplete entries.
In the controller, handling validation errors gracefully by rendering the appropriate view ensures a smooth user experience,
guiding users to correct any input issues.
